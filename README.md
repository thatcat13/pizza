# Epicodus Week 4 Intro: Solo Project

Order a Pizza: Cat Janowitz; November 3, 2017

#### By Cat Janowitz

## Description

This is a solo project that involves the design of an app for ordering pizza. The user selects the size of pizza and any topping(s) they choose, then the final cost is displayed.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* User selects one of 3 sizes using a dropdown menu that provides: Small, Medium, or Large
* A custom prototype method is used, containing if/else ifs to add to a base cost, for the Pizza object:
* The base price of a pizza is $8.00 for a small. If the user selects Medium or Large, the price increases to $11.00 and $14.00, respectively (i.e., base price += $3.00 for Medium; base price += $6.00 for Large)
* The price of the sized pizza will increase depending on how many toppings are added:
  * sized price (i.e., 8, 11 or 14 dollars) += $2.00 for EACH meat topping
  * sized price (i.e., 8, 11 or 14 dollars) += $1.00 for EACH veggie topping

* EXAMPLE INPUT:
  * Selected Size: Medium ($11)
  * Selected Toppings: Extra Cheese ($1), Candied Bacon ($2), Peppers ($1)

* EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
  * Your Total: $15.00
